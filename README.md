## Installation
    
Clone the repository files to your local machine and navigate to the root directory of that folder in your terminal / gitbash window. Run the command 'node index.js' and answer the prompts until the console message "Success!" is displayed. A Generated_README.md file is then rendered to the output folder based off the user's prompt responses. 

Note: This application will not run if [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is not installed on your machine.
